---

### 🔹 Instant Review & Feedback
After completing the quiz, users receive:
- Their selected answer
- The correct answer
- A short explanation for conceptual clarity

This helps learners immediately identify **where and why** they went wrong.

### 🔹 Diagnostic Report
- Performance score displayed as a percentage
- Clear learning status (e.g., *Reinforcement Needed*)
- Threshold-based evaluation (70% benchmark)
- Suggests learning using the **Feynman Technique** for weak areas

Example:
> **Score: 20%**  
> Status: Reinforcement Needed  
> Recommendation: Simplify and relearn core concepts

### 🔹 Concept Reinforcement (Feynman Technique)

NeoVihar reinforces learning using the Feynman Technique, which focuses on understanding concepts by explaining them in the simplest possible way.

Complex topics such as Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), OSEMN workflow, SQL, and Data Cleaning are broken down into plain, easy-to-understand explanations

Concepts are explained as if teaching a beginner, helping learners identify and fix gaps in understanding

Uses step-by-step logic, real-world analogies, and short explanations instead of heavy theory

Encourages clarity over memorization, ensuring learners truly understand why something works, not just what it is

This approach helps learners build strong fundamentals and retain concepts for long-term application.
